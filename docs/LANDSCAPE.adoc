== Current Landscape

=== Open Source Feedback Platforms

[cols="1,1,1,2"]
|===
| Project | Stars | Tech | Gap

| https://github.com/getfider/fider[Fider]
| 3.9k
| Go, PostgreSQL
| No multi-platform submission, no network verification

| https://github.com/logchimp/logchimp[LogChimp]
| 958
| Node.js, Vue, PostgreSQL
| No API for automated submission, no crash integration

| https://github.com/clearflask/clearflask[ClearFlask]
| 398
| Java, React
| Heavy, complex setup, no CLI integration

| Astuto
| ~200
| Ruby on Rails
| Simple, lacks advanced features
|===

=== OS-Level Crash Reporters

[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
| System | Platform | Architecture

| **ABRT** (Automatic Bug Reporting Tool)
| Fedora/RHEL
| Daemon-based, plugin architecture, integrates with Bugzilla. FAF (Fedora Analysis Framework) provides crash aggregation and similarity detection.

| **Apport**
| Ubuntu/Debian
| Hooks into kernel crash signals, produces .crash files, retraces via Launchpad, package hooks for metadata.

| **Windows Feedback Hub**
| Windows 10/11
| diagtrack service (SYSTEM), upvote-based prioritization, telemetry integration.

| **macOS Crash Reporter**
| macOS
| Automatic crash log collection, Apple-only destination.

| **KDE DrKonqi**
| KDE Plasma
| Crash handler with backtrace collection, Bugzilla integration.

| **GNOME Automatic Bug Reporting**
| GNOME
| abrt-gnome integration, GitLab-based upstream reporting.
|===

=== Commercial Solutions

[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| Product | Starting Price | Notes

| UserVoice
| $699/mo
| Enterprise-only, priced out small teams

| Canny
| $359/mo
| Popular, good UX, but closed source

| Productboard
| $25/user/mo
| Product management focused

| Aha!
| $59/user/mo
| Roadmap-heavy

== What's Missing Everywhere

=== 1. Multi-Platform Submission

**Problem:** Every tool is a silo. GitHub Issues don't sync with Jira. Bugzilla doesn't talk to GitLab.

**feedback-a-tron solution:**
[source,elixir]
----
FeedbackATron.Submitter.submit(issue, platforms: [:github, :gitlab, :jira, :bugzilla])
----

Single submission → multiple destinations with deduplication.

=== 2. Network-Layer Verification

**Problem:** Feedback silently fails. Network issues, rate limits, DNS problems - users never know if their feedback arrived.

**feedback-a-tron solution:**
- Pre-flight network health check
- Path MTU discovery
- Jitter and packet loss measurement
- DNSSEC/DANE verification
- BGP route origin validation
- Post-submission verification (check issue actually exists)

=== 3. Credential Rotation

**Problem:** API rate limits. Single token exhausted = all submissions fail.

**feedback-a-tron solution:**
- Multiple credentials per platform
- Automatic rotation
- Rate limit awareness
- Fallback to CLI tools (gh, glab)

=== 4. MCP Integration for AI Assistants

**Problem:** AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot) discover bugs but can't automatically report them.

**feedback-a-tron solution:**
- MCP tool `submit_feedback` exposed to Claude Code
- Automatic issue creation with context
- Deduplication against existing issues
- Semantic similarity matching

=== 5. Crash Correlation Across Platforms

**Problem:** Same crash manifests in multiple distros. No way to correlate Ubuntu Apport reports with Fedora ABRT reports.

**feedback-a-tron solution:**
- Unified crash signature format
- Cross-platform deduplication
- Similarity engine (like FAF but multi-distro)

=== 6. Semantic Issue Linking

**Problem:** Duplicate issues across repos. Related issues not linked.

**feedback-a-tron solution:**
- Datalog-based semantic querying
- RDF store for relationship tracking
- Automatic "related to" suggestions

=== 7. Interoperability Standard

**Problem:** No protocol for feedback exchange between systems.

**Proposed solution:** See our MCP security SEPs - same approach for feedback:
- `.well-known/feedback` discovery endpoint
- Standard issue exchange format (JSON-LD with schema.org)
- Cross-platform issue linking protocol

== Architecture Comparison

=== Traditional (Siloed)

[source]
----
User → Single Platform → Single Tracker → Manual Triage
----

=== ABRT/Apport (OS-Integrated)

[source]
----
Crash Signal → Daemon → Problem Directory → Retrace → Single Bugzilla
                                                ↓
                                        Aggregation (FAF)

== Standards We Should Propose

=== 1. Issue Exchange Format

Based on schema.org + extensions:

[source,json]
----
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "SoftwareBug",
  "identifier": "urn:feedback:sha256:abc123",
  "name": "Content filter false positive on .gitignore",
  "description": "...",
  "severity": "major",
  "reproducibility": "always",
  "affectedSoftware": {
    "@type": "SoftwareApplication",
    "name": "Claude Code",
    "version": "2.0.65"
  },
  "reportedBy": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "identifier": "urn:github:user:hyperpolymath"
  },
  "crossReferences": [
    "https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/13683"
  ]
}
----

=== 2. Feedback Discovery (.well-known/feedback)

[source,json]
----
{
  "feedback_version": "1.0",
  "endpoints": {
    "issues": "https://api.example.com/issues",
    "discussions": "https://api.example.com/discussions"
  },
  "supported_formats": ["json-ld", "github-issue", "jira"],
  "authentication": {
    "methods": ["oauth2", "api_key"]
  },
  "rate_limits": {
    "issues_per_hour": 100
  }
}
----

=== 3. TM Forum Alignment

TM Forum has TMF621 (Trouble Ticket Management API). We should align with this for enterprise interoperability.

== Roadmap for feedback-a-tron

=== Phase 1: Core Submission (Current)
- [x] Multi-platform issue submission
- [x] Credential rotation
- [x] Network verification
- [x] MCP tool integration

=== Phase 2: Intelligence
- [ ] Semantic deduplication (Datalog engine)
- [ ] Cross-platform issue linking
- [ ] Crash signature extraction
- [ ] Similarity matching

=== Phase 3: Standards
- [ ] Propose .well-known/feedback to IETF
- [ ] Schema.org vocabulary for bugs
- [ ] TMF621 compatibility layer

=== Phase 4: Distribution Integration
- [ ] ABRT plugin for multi-platform submission
- [ ] Apport hook for cross-distro correlation
- [ ] Windows Feedback Hub bridge (WSL)
